## Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering
In this project-based course, we will create a recommendation system using Collaborative Filtering with help of `Scikit-surprise` library, which learns from past user behavior. We will be working with a movie lense dataset and by the end of this project, we will be able to give unique movie recommendations for every user based on their past ratings.
