# **Coursera Guided Projects**

## [Computer Vision - Object Detection with OpenCV and Python](https://github.com/shejz/Coursera-guided-projects/tree/master/Computer%20Vision%20-%20Object%20Detection%20with%20OpenCV%20and%20Python)

## [Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering](https://github.com/shejz/Coursera-guided-projects/tree/master/Movie%20Recommendation%20System%20using%20Collaborative%20Filtering)
In this project-based course, we will create a recommendation system using Collaborative Filtering with help of `Scikit-surprise` library, which learns from past user behavior. We will be working with a movie lense dataset and by the end of this project, we will be able to give unique movie recommendations for every user based on their past ratings.

## [Medical Diagnosis using Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/shejz/Coursera-guided-projects/tree/master/Medical%20Diagnosis%20using%20Support%20Vector%20Machines)
The dataset we are going to use comes from the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases**, and contains anonymized diagnostic measurements for a set of female patients.  We will train a **support vector machine** to predict whether a new patient has diabetes based on such measurements.
